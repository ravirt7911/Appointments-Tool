# Appointments Tool
The Appointments Tool is a simple and intuitive web application designed to manage appointments efficiently. Users can view, schedule, update, and delete appointments with ease.

## Features
#### Display Free/Busy Slots:
The first screen provides a visual representation of free and busy slots for a given week.
Each slot is 1 hour long, with 6 slots available per day from 10 am to 4 pm.
Both free and busy slots are distinctly rendered, providing a clear overview.

#### Select Free Slots:
Users can click on the free areas to select and book an available timeslot.

#### Appointment Booking:
Once a user selects a free slot, a pop-up window appears to enter personal details and complete the booking process.

#### Update or Delete Appointments:
Users have the flexibility to update or delete their existing appointments.
The update option allows users to modify their personal details for a particular appointment.

#### Drag and Drop Functionality:
Enhancing user convenience, the application supports drag and drop functionality.
Users can drag and drop an appointment to the next available slot, providing a seamless rescheduling experience.

#### Show App Version:
A new button has been added on the main screen to display the current app version from the package configuration.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
